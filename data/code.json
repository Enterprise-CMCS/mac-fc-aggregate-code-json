It empowers Federal and state administration to evolve efficiently with ongoing programmatic and technological changes.  MACFin has improved the technology, functionality, and efficiency of the existing financial processes, thus providing a consolidated solution to Medicaid and CHIP financial administration and oversight.  MACFin is iteratively assuming responsibilities and business functions previously provided by the existing Medicaid and CHIP Budget and Expenditure (MBES/CBES) system, has integrated the Incurred But Not Reported Survey (IBNRS) system and processes, and is integrating and automating financial management processes external to MBES/CBES and IBNRS.",

Built with ASP.NET MVC and C#, the system provides complex workflow management with status tracking, role-based access control, automated reporting and notifications, comprehensive audit trails, and multi-environment support. The application serves as a critical component of the Medicaid infrastructure, ensuring proper oversight and timely processing of state submissions that impact healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. The system includes sophisticated business rules, validation logic, automated email alerts, extensive reporting capabilities, and user management features that support the complex regulatory requirements of Medicaid program administration.",

It leverages Kafka Connect service deployed to ECS Fargate with a JDBC Source connector that monitors MMDL's Oracle database for data changes and streams them to topics in CMS Bigmac. The system includes multiple integrated services: connector service for data streaming, ksqlDB for data processing and table creation, alerts service for monitoring, and dashboard service for visualization. AWS Lambda functions handle topic creation, deployment operations, and configuration management. The architecture includes automated password management with EventBridge handlers that respond to AWS Secrets Manager changes, ensuring continuous operation during scheduled maintenance windows. The solution provides real-time healthcare data analytics capabilities for CMS Medicaid operations with comprehensive monitoring through AWS CloudWatch and automated alerting systems.",
